Our project, **AI-Enabled Indoor Autonomous Delivery Robot for Smart Workspace and Industrial Automation**, received the **Championship Award** at **BEAR Summit 2025** in the *Robotics Demo Digital Display* segment.

The award recognizes the innovation, technical excellence, and real-world relevance of our proof-of-concept prototype, evaluated by leading experts in robotics, automation, and digital transformation. During the event, we showcased the system’s autonomous navigation, perception pipeline, and integrated web-based control interface, followed by interactive demonstrations and technical Q&A.

While this recognition validates the potential of our prototype, our vision extends further. We are now actively working to evolve this research prototype into a **fully refined, production-ready product prototype** suitable for real-world deployment.
