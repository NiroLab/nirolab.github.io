The **NSU Intelligent Robotics Lab (NIRO)** successfully conducted a **Robotics Workshop** aimed at introducing students to the fundamentals of robotics and hands-on system development. The workshop was held in two sessions to accommodate participant availability—on **Sunday, March 16, 2025, at 2:00 PM**, and again on **Thursday, March 20, 2025, at 10:00 AM**—at the **NIRO Lab Workstation**.

Each session lasted approximately **three hours** and was conducted by **Saif Ahammod Khan** and **Nasim Mahmud**, both **Research Assistants at NIRO Lab**. The first session was attended by **13 participants**, while the second session saw a full capacity of approximately **25 attendees**, reflecting strong interest and enthusiasm for hands-on robotics education among students.

The workshop covered a comprehensive range of foundational robotics topics. Participants were introduced to **basic electronics concepts**, including types of current, power sources, voltage, current, and resistance. The sessions also explored **microcontrollers, sensors, DC motors, actuators, and communication modules**, followed by practical discussions on **robot wiring, circuit design, Arduino programming**, and coding using the **Arduino IDE**. In addition, participants were introduced to **robot body construction techniques**, various **building materials**, and **basic 3D design concepts**.

As part of the hands-on component, the instructors, with active participation from attendees, **built an RC car from scratch**, demonstrating the complete development process—from circuit design to final implementation. The workshop concluded with an **interactive question-and-answer session**, allowing participants to clarify technical concepts and reflect on their learning experiences. A group photo session followed, capturing the engagement and enthusiasm of the participants.

Feedback received from participants was overwhelmingly positive, highlighting the clarity of technical explanations, structured content delivery, and the practical approach of the sessions. Participants also provided constructive suggestions, including optimizing session duration and incorporating additional equipment to enable individual project building alongside the instructor.

The successful completion of the workshop reflects **NIRO Lab’s continued commitment to robotics education, practical learning, and skill development**. The lab looks forward to organizing more structured, hands-on workshops in the future to further support student learning and innovation.
