## Overview

This project addresses the challenge of robot navigation in environments where GPS signals are unavailable, such as indoor spaces, underground facilities, or dense urban areas.

## Objectives

- Implement visual-inertial SLAM system
- Develop loop closure detection for large environments
- Create efficient map representations
- Achieve real-time performance on mobile platforms

## Methodology

We combine visual odometry from cameras with inertial measurements for robust state estimation. Graph optimization is used for global consistency.

## Current Progress

- Implemented feature-based visual odometry
- Testing loop closure detection
- Benchmarking against standard datasets
- Planning deployment on mobile robot
