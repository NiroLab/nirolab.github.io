## Overview

This project aims to develop efficient computer vision systems that can run on resource-constrained robotic platforms. We focus on optimizing state-of-the-art object detection models for real-time performance.

## Objectives

- Optimize deep learning models for embedded deployment
- Achieve real-time detection at 30+ FPS on edge devices
- Develop domain-specific training datasets
- Create a modular vision pipeline for various robot applications

## Methodology

We employ model compression techniques including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation to reduce model complexity while maintaining accuracy. Our custom dataset includes objects commonly encountered in indoor environments.

## Current Progress

- Achieved 25 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson Nano
- Created dataset with 10,000+ labeled images
- Published preliminary results at regional conference
