## Overview

This project explores new ways for humans to interact with robots naturally and intuitively. We are developing multimodal interfaces that combine voice commands, gestures, and visual feedback.

## Objectives

- Develop natural language understanding for robot commands
- Implement gesture recognition for non-verbal interaction
- Create adaptive interfaces that learn user preferences
- Evaluate usability with human subject studies

## Methodology

We use transformer-based language models fine-tuned for robot command interpretation, combined with computer vision for gesture recognition. The system adapts to individual users over time.

## Current Progress

- Implemented basic voice command system with 85% accuracy
- Gesture recognition prototype detecting 10 common gestures
- Planning user studies for interface evaluation
