## Overview

This project develops autonomous drone systems for environmental monitoring applications. We focus on automated data collection in areas that are difficult or dangerous for humans to access.

## Objectives

- Develop autonomous flight planning for survey missions
- Integrate environmental sensors with drone platform
- Create data processing pipeline for collected measurements
- Deploy system for real-world environmental studies

## Methodology

We combine GPS-waypoint navigation with computer vision for precise positioning. Drones carry customized sensor payloads for air quality, temperature, and humidity measurement.

## Current Progress

- Completed hardware integration
- Tested autonomous flight in controlled environment
- Developing data visualization dashboard
