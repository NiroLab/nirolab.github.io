## Overview

This project focuses on developing robust autonomous navigation capabilities for mobile robots operating in indoor environments. We combine classical path planning algorithms with modern deep learning approaches to create systems that can navigate safely and efficiently.

## Objectives

- Develop real-time localization algorithms using sensor fusion
- Implement obstacle avoidance using deep learning
- Create efficient path planning for dynamic environments
- Build a complete navigation stack for our mobile robot platform

## Methodology

Our approach integrates multiple sensing modalities including LiDAR, RGB-D cameras, and wheel encoders. We use a combination of particle filter-based localization and neural network-based perception to achieve robust navigation.

## Current Progress

- Completed initial sensor integration and calibration
- Developed baseline localization algorithm with 95% accuracy
- Currently training obstacle detection neural network
- Testing in lab environment with plans for building-wide deployment
