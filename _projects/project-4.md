## Overview

This project investigates how multiple robots can work together efficiently to accomplish tasks that are difficult or impossible for a single robot. We focus on decentralized coordination approaches.

## Objectives

- Develop distributed task allocation algorithms
- Implement inter-robot communication protocols
- Create collision avoidance for multi-robot systems
- Demonstrate coordinated exploration and mapping

## Methodology

We use a combination of auction-based task allocation and potential field methods for coordination. Each robot operates semi-autonomously while sharing information with teammates.

## Current Progress

- Implemented basic communication framework
- Tested two-robot coordination in simulation
- Preparing for hardware deployment on three robots
