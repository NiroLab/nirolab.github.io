## Overview

Manual delivery of documents and small items inside large office environments such as universities, banks, hospitals, and corporate offices is time-consuming, costly, and prone to confidentiality risks. With the rapid growth of organized office infrastructures in Bangladesh, there is a clear demand for automated, secure, and efficient internal logistics solutions.

This project focuses on the design and development of an **Autonomous Indoor Delivery Robot** capable of navigating complex indoor environments and delivering documents or packages with minimal human intervention. The system integrates autonomous navigation, perception, hardware–software co-design, and a web-based control interface to ensure reliable operation in real-world office settings.

Building on a validated proof-of-concept prototype, the project is now transitioning toward a **full-scale, product-ready system**, emphasizing robustness, scalability, security, and deployability for industry applications.

## Objectives

- Design and develop a fully autonomous indoor delivery robot for organized office environments  
- Implement reliable indoor navigation using SLAM, path planning, and obstacle avoidance  
- Integrate secure, user-friendly WebApp-based task assignment and monitoring  
- Transition from research prototype to an industry-ready product prototype  

## Methodology

The project follows a modular, ROS2-based development pipeline combining simulation, hardware prototyping, and real-world testing. Navigation and mapping are developed using **SLAM techniques** (2D and 3D) with sensor fusion from LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMU data. Path planning and motion control leverage classical and learning-based approaches for safe and efficient navigation in dynamic indoor environments.

Simulation is performed using **ROS2 and Gazebo**, enabling rapid testing and validation before deployment. The physical prototype integrates custom electronics, motor controllers, and embedded computing platforms. A **WebApp interface** allows users to request deliveries, monitor robot status, and manage tasks securely. Continuous testing in real office environments ensures robustness and practical feasibility.

## Current Progress

- Developed and tested a proof-of-concept autonomous delivery robot prototype  
- Implemented ROS2-based navigation with 2D/3D mapping and real-world deployment  
- Designed and assembled multiple hardware iterations of the robot  
- Developed a WebApp for navigation control and task monitoring  
- Successfully tested the system in real office environments  

**Upcoming milestones:**
- Full-scale product prototype design and fabrication  
- Enhanced perception and safety features  
- System optimization for long-term deployment and maintenance  
- Industry-oriented pilot deployment and evaluation
