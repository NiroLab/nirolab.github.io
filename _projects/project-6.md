## Overview

This project aims to create an affordable, open-source robot platform that can be used for robotics education. The goal is to make robotics accessible to students regardless of their institution's resources.

## Objectives

- Design robot costing under $100 in parts
- Create comprehensive educational materials
- Develop beginner-friendly programming interface
- Open-source all designs and documentation

## Methodology

We use 3D-printed components, affordable microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP32), and common sensors to minimize costs while maintaining educational value.

## Current Progress

- Completed mechanical design (rev 2)
- Basic software stack operational
- Developing curriculum materials
- Testing with undergraduate students
