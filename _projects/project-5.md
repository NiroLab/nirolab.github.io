## Overview

This project explores how robots can learn complex behaviors through reinforcement learning rather than explicit programming. We focus on manipulation and locomotion tasks.

## Objectives

- Develop sim-to-real transfer techniques
- Train policies for robotic manipulation
- Implement safe exploration strategies
- Reduce sample complexity for real-world learning

## Methodology

We train policies in simulation using modern RL algorithms (PPO, SAC) and transfer learned behaviors to real robots using domain randomization and adaptation techniques.

## Current Progress

- Achieved stable grasping in simulation
- Developing sim-to-real pipeline
- Testing basic manipulation on robot arm
