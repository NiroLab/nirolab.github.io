As a Student researcher, Shafwan Ahmed is motivated by project-based learning and hands-on experimentation, aiming to develop scalable, reliable solutions that bridge theoretical concepts with practical implementation. His work focuses on integrating embedded systems, perception, and control to build practical drone-based solutions, particularly for swarm coordination, lightweight payload delivery, and real-world deployment scenarios.

Shafwan Ahmed is currently working extensively with Pixhawk flight controllers, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino platforms, developing systems that involve MAVLink communication, ground control integration, and real-time monitoring. Especially focussing on bridging high-level planning with low-level control, enabling multiple drones to operate cooperatively using both GPS-based and local coordination approaches.

Alongside robotics , Shafwan Ahmed has completed CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science from HarvardX and is currently on his way to completing his undergraduation, which strengthened his understanding of core concepts such as algorithms, data structures, memory management, and computational thinking. His other experience includes programming in C, C++, Python, and Java, as well as full-stack development using frameworks such as React, Next.js, Node.js, and Django, which he wants to use to design control interfaces, visualization tools, and supporting infrastructure for autonomous systems.

As a graduate researcher, Tajnimul Hossain focuses on the design and control of intelligent robotic systems, with a particular emphasis on multi-drone coordination and autonomous robotics. His research explores how advanced control strategies and machine learning techniques can be integrated to enable reliable, scalable, and safe operation of multiple robots in real-world environments.
His primary research direction involves formation control, trajectory planning, and cooperative control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for applications such as infrastructure inspection, monitoring, and autonomous deployment. By combining classical control theory with data-driven methods, his work aims to enhance robustness, adaptability, and fault tolerance in dynamic and uncertain environments.
Currently, his interests include developing control-aware learning frameworks, where stability principles from control theory—such as feedback control and Lyapunov-based methods—are embedded into learning-based robotic systems. This approach seeks to bridge the gap between theoretical guarantees and real-world deployment of autonomous multi-robot systems.","Robotics, Multi-Drone Systems, Control Systems, Machine Learning As a graduate researcher, Tajnimul Hossain focuses on the design and control of intelligent robotic systems, with a particular emphasis on multi-drone coordination and autonomous robotics.

His current research explores coordinated swarm behavior for task execution, where multiple robots operate collaboratively while maintaining certain formations. This work aims to enable efficient coverage, robustness, and scalability in outdoor environments, with particular relevance to agricultural applications such as large-area pesticide spraying and monitoring. By designing formation control and coordination strategies, his research contributes toward making swarm robotic systems more practical for deployment in dynamic, real-world settings. In parallel, Md. Tasbeer Ahmed is actively involved in a human–robot interaction (HRI) project that investigates how robot behaviors influence human actions. This work seeks to demonstrate how socially aware robotic actions can encourage positive human behavior, with an application focus on pollution reduction through an HRI-based Anti-Litter system.

Currently, his ongoing research includes drone swarm behavior for coordinated tasks and the development of HRI frameworks for socially impactful robotic systems.","Mobile Robotics, Human-Robot Interaction, Swarm Robotics",tasbeer.ahmed.201@gmail.com
