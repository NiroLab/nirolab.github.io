Md. Tasbeer Ahmed is working in the areas of swarm robotics and human-robot interaction at NIRO Lab.

## Research Focus

His current research explores coordinated swarm behavior for task execution, where multiple robots operate collaboratively while maintaining certain formations. This work aims to enable efficient coverage, robustness, and scalability in outdoor environments, with particular relevance to agricultural applications such as large-area pesticide spraying and monitoring. By designing formation control and coordination strategies, his research contributes toward making swarm robotic systems more practical for deployment in dynamic, real-world settings.

## Human-Robot Interaction

He is actively involved in a human-robot interaction (HRI) project that investigates how robot behaviors influence human actions. This work seeks to demonstrate how socially aware robotic actions can encourage positive human behavior, with an application focus on pollution reduction through an HRI-based Anti-Litter system.

## Current Work

His ongoing research includes drone swarm behavior for coordinated tasks and the development of HRI frameworks for socially impactful robotic systems.
