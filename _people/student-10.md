Shafwan Ahmed is motivated by project-based learning and hands-on experimentation, aiming to develop scalable, reliable solutions that bridge theoretical concepts with practical implementation. His work focuses on integrating embedded systems, perception, and control to build practical drone-based solutions, particularly for swarm coordination, lightweight payload delivery, and real-world deployment scenarios.

## Research Focus

He is currently working extensively with Pixhawk flight controllers, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino platforms, developing systems that involve MAVLink communication, ground control integration, and real-time monitoring. His focus is on bridging high-level planning with low-level control, enabling multiple drones to operate cooperatively using both GPS-based and local coordination approaches.

## Background

Shafwan has completed CS50's Introduction to Computer Science from HarvardX, which strengthened his understanding of core concepts such as algorithms, data structures, memory management, and computational thinking. His experience includes programming in C, C++, Python, and Java, as well as full-stack development using frameworks such as React, Next.js, Node.js, and Django, which he applies to design control interfaces, visualization tools, and supporting infrastructure for autonomous systems.
