Mohammed Mofiz Uddin earned his Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) from North South University in 2025 and is currently a Research Assistant at NIRO Lab.

## Research Focus

He focuses on autonomous quadrotor systems, with an emphasis on optimal and efficient Coverage Path Planning (CPP) algorithms. His research encompasses both deterministic methods and heuristic approaches, including Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), adapted for UAV path planning in area coverage and air quality monitoring applications.

He is working on how UAV-based sensing platforms integrate low-cost environmental pollution and particulate matter monitors with optimized flight kinematics to characterize pollutant distribution in urban environments.

## Other Work

Additionally, he also serves as a Research Assistant at the Mahzabeen Lab, where he is extensively working towards the development of an intelligent assistive wearable for the elderly.

## Achievements

During his undergraduate studies, his group was crowned Champion of the NSU Capstone Innovation Challenge Season 16 for his Senior Capstone Design.
