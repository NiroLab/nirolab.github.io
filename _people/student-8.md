As a student researcher, Farhana Mehazbin Tusti is interested in advancing autonomous robotic systems through the integration of perception, learning, and simulation-driven development. Her work focuses on building reliable and adaptable robots capable of operating in dynamic and unstructured environments using data-driven and physics-aware approaches.

## Research Areas

Her interests include:
- Robotic perception, visual servoing, and manipulation in simulated and real-world settings
- Leveraging ROS2 and Gazebo to design, test, and validate autonomous behaviors
- Improving sim-to-real transfer through techniques such as self-supervised learning

In parallel, she explores machine learning applications in scientific and medical domains, working on projects in advanced deep learning methods and computer vision.

She aims to combine simulation, data-driven modeling, and intelligent control to develop scalable, interpretable, and real-world-ready autonomous systems.
